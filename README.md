## Lo there! 😉

- 💻 Currently doing my undergrad in Computer Science 
- 🔭 Prolific tinkerer, hacker(as per the old definition), arch btw.
- 📚 Knows Svelte (Kit), React, C, Python, Bash, and a whole lot other langs which I'm familier with.
- ⌨️ Likes to type [fast](https://monkeytype.com/profile/VicFic) (Avg 102 WPM/ PB 150 WPM)

The repo's you will find on my profile are a mix of random small personal projects like ZeroHide and AnyMailMerge and hackathon apps like [OoruFix](https://github.com/vicfic18/OoruFix), [StudyFlow](https://github.com/vicfic18/studyflow) and [ReTron](https://github.com/TotalyEnglizLitrate/Vashisht_hackathon_25) which I built with my teammates in ridiculous timeframes. There are also my semester projects [ATSS](https://github.com/Unhandled-Exceptions/ATSS) and [Cart-Tel](https://github.com/vicfic18/cart-tel/)(intentional pun) here.

Take a look around, and visit my [website](https://vicfic.neocities.org/) if you get a chance 😊.
